**noon--1:30pm**: Lunch with discussion groups

We'll select topics for discussion over lunch, assign groups to [topics][], and choose a scribe for each group. The scribe will be responsible for reporting out from the discussion after lunch.

**1:30--1:45pm**: Discussion report-outs

Each group's scribe has a few minutes to lead discussion on the results from the lunch topic.
